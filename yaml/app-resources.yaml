âœ¨ Attempting to apply the following manifest:
Sure, here is an example of a ConfigMap with resource usage configuration for CPU and memory:


apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: resource-usage-config
data:
  cpu: "500m"
  memory: "500Mi"


And here is how you would use those values in a Pod:


apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: large-mem-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: large-mem-container
    image: example
    resources:
      limits:
        memory: $(MEMORY_LIMIT)
      requests:
        memory: $(MEMORY_REQUEST)
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: resource-usage-config


Please replace `example` with a real container image.

Although you can set all the values directly in the Pod's definition, configuring these values using a ConfigMap makes it more convenient to adjust resource usage across several Pods or containers, or to manage configurations for different environments.

Note: The values `$(MEMORY_LIMIT)` and `$(MEMORY_REQUEST)` will be replaced by the respective values from the `resource-usage-config` ConfigMap. This feature is available starting from Kubernetes v1.20.
